# Prim-and-Kruskal-and-Dijkstry-and-Bellman-Ford-Algorithms-on-graph

Project created for universities. Project implemented for classes from Data structures and computational complexity. Examination of the effectiveness of graph algorithms depending on the size of the instance and how the graph is represented in the computer's memory.
<br/><br/>
The program has four algorithms implemented:
<br/>Kruskal's algorithm
<br/>Prim's algorithm 
<br/>Dijkstra's algorithm
<br/>Bellman-Ford algorithm
<br/><br/>
The program accepts data in a txt file or generates test data after selecting the test option at the beginning of the program.
